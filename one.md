### 1.1.W1
### 1.1.M1 | Installing Atom

Atom is an Open Source text editor, which is widely used due to its customizability. Being able to use a text editor is fundamenetal to programming, think of it as your pen & paper for writing code. We will be using Atom in this course, however there are plenty of other options to choose from, although we will not be supporting any other editors in this course.
