### Getting ready for Unity.



### Downloading Unity

You will need to download a version of the Unity 3D Engine. Follow the link below to start this:

### https://store.unity.com/download?ref=personal

* Accept the Terms of Conditions

* Click "Download Installer for Mac OS X" / "Download Installer for Windows"

    * If you don't see your Operating, there should be a button to change version right below the Download button.

### The Unity Courseware

This is the most important link from here on out. We recommend you bookmark it somewhere.

# http://unity.codecadets.com



This content will make up most of what we do from here on it, so it's quite important that you **remember your username and password** for the site.

The courseware contains a series of short videos divided into distinct chapters, designed to guide you through the game design and development process. As such, it will be important for you to bring headphones to this and future sessions of Code Cadets as to not disturb others.


### The End Goal



By the time we are done with the Unity courseware, our intent is to have everyone sit the Unity Developer Certification Exam; which on completion will mean you are certified to make games in the Unity engine.

The content of the Courseware will be reviewed at the end of each chapter with a small self review quiz like the example below.
