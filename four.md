| git add --all | **Add all** files to the git repo. |
| git commit -am "message goes here"      | **Commits** the current set of changes. Think of it like saving. |
| git push | **Pushes** your commits to the remote repository (the one stored on GitHub)|
| git clone URL | **Clones** the the repository at the **URL** you give the command, for example the GitHub address of the repo.
