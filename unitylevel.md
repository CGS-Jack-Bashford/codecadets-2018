### The goal : build a level and map

A level is the basis of all games. For these sessions we want to have finished building it so that we can move onto placing our player, enemies and implementing attacks and AI using actual code.

The courseware intends for you to build the map depicted here. Yours does not need to exactly follow this template, but it's a useful reference point for a simple level design.

### The Terrain tool

Whilst not directly from the courseware itself, the terrain tool is useful for building quick maps. You can find it in the menu here.

You can use the various brushes (see on the right) to create various mappings of altitude.

And add textures to your terrain. You can use any texture currently in the Project Files that you've downloaded from the Unity store.

You can also import downloaded images for custom terrains from the menu like so.

### Useful Resources

The videos from chapter 6 detail the placement of world objects.
