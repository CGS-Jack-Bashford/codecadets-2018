### Getting ready for Unity.





### The Unity Courseware

This is the most important link from here on out. We recommend you bookmark it somewhere.

# [http://unity.codecadets.com](http://unity.codecadets.com)

The courseware contains a series of short videos divided into distinct chapters, designed to guide you through the game design and development process. As such, it will be important for you to bring headphones to this and future sessions of Code Cadets as to not disturb others.

#### Signing into the Courseware

Your details are already registered into the system:

* Username: YOURIDNUMBER@cgs.act.edu.au

  * This is the number you use to log into school computers, for example 17121@cgs.act.edu.au


* Password: "cgs" followed by your birthday and year in YYYYMMDD format

    * Example: cgs20041024 for someone born October 24, 2004.

This content will make up most of what we do from here on it, so it's quite important that you **remember your username and password** for the site.


### Downloading Unity

You will need to download a version of the Unity 3D Engine. Follow the link below to start this:

### [https://store.unity.com/download?ref=personal](https://store.unity.com/download?ref=personal)

OR

###[http://cdn.codecadets.com/](http://cdn.codecadets.com/)

* Accept the Terms of Conditions

* Click "Download Installer for Mac OS X" / "Download Installer for Windows"

    * If you don't see your Operating, there should be a button to change version right below the Download button.

#### <font color='red'>You will need to create a separate login for the Unity Engine and Courseware. Make your details the same if possible, to help you remember.</font>


### The End Goal



By the time we are done with the Unity courseware, our intent is to have everyone sit the Unity Developer Certification Exam; which on completion will mean you are certified to make games in the Unity engine.

The content of the Courseware will be reviewed at the end of each chapter with a small self review quiz like the example below.
