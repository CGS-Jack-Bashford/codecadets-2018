 What do I do if I need to permanently change to a different session?
 </summary>

   If your personal circumstances change, you may need to change to a different session. If this is the case, you can send an email to your tutor using their email from here that has the following:
   - The session that you are currently enrolled in
   -  The session that you would like to switch to
   -  The reason for the change
   We ask that parents also send an email to the tutor.
