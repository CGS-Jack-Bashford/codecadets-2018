## Attendance and Session Logistics

### Do I need to attend every session?

Yep, if you miss a session you may miss important content that the next session might build upon!

### What do I do if I can't attend a session in a single week?

When you can't attend a session, have a look at the session list and see if you can find an alternative session. If the tutor is the same, contact your tutor and let them know which session you'll be attending and why you're switching for that week. If the tutor is different, you'll need to email *both* your tutor and the tutor who will be running the alternative session.

### What do I do if I need to switch sessions permanently?

When something about your timetable changes and you have different commitments on different days please get your parents to contact your tutor so that we can arrange a permanent solution.

### What do I do if I need to leave a session early?

We prefer it if you stay for the whole session and ask that if you anticipate leaving early then consider switching to a different session for that particular week. If in doubt, contact your tutor before the session.

## Expectations

### I feel as though I'm slipping behind on the content, is it worth staying on?

Definitely! These things happen and sometimes you can lose your way. When you get to University you'll find that much of your learning is self guided and sometimes things aren't even explained to you at all! There's an expectation that you'll work it out on your own there! First things first, make sure during the sessions you're asking questions and engaging with the content, we try and make the lab outines as clear as possible to make things easily absorbable. At any time feel free to let your tutor know that you're having difficulty keeping up or understanding something and we'll be happy to work through your troubles one-on-one.

### I can't do the set work this week, will I get a detention?

Programming is hard. High school can be the most stressful and the hardest part of growing up and it would be unfair to add another whole subject on to your already busy schedule. All we ask as tutors and as a program is for you to give it your all while you're with us and occasionally complete quizes and small tasks at home.
